A cheerful person from Belarus. Ready to study and create cool stuff using the latest available JS, CSS and HTML features. As a member of start-up team at Svetlogorsk Bleached Pulp Mill (2016-2019) have strong technical knowledges. Currently working as an operator using "DCS Honywell" software on a daily basis.

I've been studying at European Humanities University and Minsk State Linguistic University (distantly) took some soft-skills such as English, ability to work with information and write academical essays.

var Ball = function(ballType) {
  this.ballType = ballType;
  this.ballType == "super" ? this.ballType = "super" : this.ballType = "regular"
